# Blockchain-Project-to-analyze-many-Hashing-Algorithm
In this project , I am using NetBeans IDE for JAVA , JAVA 8 , Apache-Tomcat Server .

The basic aim of the project: 
1- To develop a blockchain in which the number of the mined block is given by the user. 
2- Calculate hash values to apply various hashing algorithm ( like: SHA-256 , MD2 , MD5 , SHA-224 , SHA-512 , SHA-384 and some more) 
3- Analyze the elapsed time and efficiency of each Algorithm.
